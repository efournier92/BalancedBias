## Overview
In these politically-polarizing times, I wanted to create a mean for users to ingest news from a healthy balance of media sources. Since most news outlets broadcast an RSS feed, I decided that was the best data source available. Hence, I selected XXXXX media channels, ranked them from most liberal to most conservative, and laid them out on the same page. My aim is to provide insight into how different outlets are covering the same story. I also save all articles to a database, such that historical data will be persisted, and further insight can be gained by tracking a news story by keyword over time. I hope this project will help balance the media consumption for users everywhere.

## Development Philosophy
In addition to providing the high-level functionality described in [Overview](#overview), I also wanted to develop this application using a very specific stack. I currently work as a .NET developer on a large legacy WebForms application. Since much of this platform was built before I joined, there were numerous aspects I've learned to plug into, but have never built myself from scratch. In designing this application, rather than referencing online resources, I referenced the codebase of the project I work on professionally. Hence giving it a WebForms feel, which feels is at least a decade behind anything I've developed previously. That said, this project gave me an excellent excuse to grow more accustomed to WebForms patterns, and to practice building certain .NET patterns from the ground up, namely:
- Inversion of Control via Dependency Injection
-
